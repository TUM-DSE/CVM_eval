## Setup

Spawn 2 VMs that have connectivity between them (can ping each other)
On the server side, generate a certificate with

```
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes --addext 'subjectAltName=IP:172.45.0.2'
```

Also give the generated file to the client.

The file `outb.c` needs to be compiled as a `.so` file named `libmy_outb.so`.

## Measurements

To get the measuremets as they are generated, open a new terminal and run `sudo bpftrace boot_time_evl.bt`.

The server can be started by running `https_server.py` in one VM. Calling `call_client.py` in the other VM will call the `https_clieny.py` script multiple times to generate the results.

The results generated by `bpftrace` can then be parsed using the `parse_https_measurements.py` script.
